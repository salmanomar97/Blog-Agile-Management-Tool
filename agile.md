## What is AGILE?
Agile is a very common method of project management used by many companies in the IT industry. Agile enables companies to design and create their products from scratch. This is crucial for companies when they are in the developmental cycle. Software companies can benefit the most because it allows them to keep track of the product and improve it throughout the development.

3.	Customer collaboration is more vital than contract negotiation
