## Scrum
Scrum is a very popular framework that is used to implement Agile development. Scrum is used by everyone from the FBI to marketing agencies. Whenever a product is being produced, such as software or a car, scrum can be a handy tool to save time and get the work done.
## What makes up Scrum?
* Scrum starts witht the product owner who is responsible for the final product and works on behalf of the user's best interests.
* The product owner then works on the backlog. The backlog is a list of tasks of tasks and requirements that need to be fulfilled in the final project. One of the reasons why the product owner works on the backlog is due to priortization. Some things can't be done without others and the tasks need to be in a manner that can be completed.
* Sprint - Sprint is a preset timeframe given to the scrum team to complete the tasks from the backlog. The typical time is two weeks but it comes down to the team completing the task.
* Retrospective - Once the sprint is completed, it comes to the review stage, or retrospective. This is when the sprints are reviewed and the team discusses roles and approaches for the next sprints as they move along in the product development cycle.
